# PHY688GWAstronomy
PHY 688 (Special Topics): Gravitational Wave Astronomy

This course will explore the field of gravitational wave astronomy.  The field has experienced a number of milestones recently, including the first detection of gravitational waves---GW150914, a pair of merging solar-mass black holes---and the first detection of an electromagnetic signal from a gravitational-wave source---GW170817, a merging binary neutron star---and anticipates more exciting results in the near future as the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors resume operations at upgraded sensitivity in late 2018/early 2019.  The scope of the course will be driven by student interest, but possible topics include: the theory of gravitational wave emission, the astrophysics of gravitational wave sources and their progenitors, gravitational wave detectors and their engineering challenges, multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational wave sources, gravitational wave data analysis and astrostatistics, populations of gravitational wave sources, cosmology/cosmography with gravitational waves.  Students will be asked to read the primary astrophysical literature on topics of their choice and, with the assistance of the instructor, facilitate discussion with the class.  There will also be a project on a topic chosen with the advice of the instructor in the second half of the term.  Though the course is at the graduate level, interested undergraduates are encouraged to enroll.

See the [Paper List and Schedule](https://github.com/farr/PHY688GWAstronomy/wiki/Paper-List-&-Schedule) for suggestions on papers to present in this course.
